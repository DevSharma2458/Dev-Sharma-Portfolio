        I developed a centralized system for  <strong>subdomain enumeration, malware analysis,
        threat mapping, and automated reporting</strong>, built using <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>REST</strong> framework.
        The platform helped the organization by streamlining security checks into one solution,
        reducing manual effort, and providing data-driven insights for faster <strong>vulnerability
        assessment</strong>. It offered features like real-time monitoring, automated report generation,
        and actionable recommendations to strengthen their security posture. This impactful project
        was recognized and selected for the <strong>Dewang Mehta IT Awards 2025</strong>.
